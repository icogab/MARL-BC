# MARL-BC
Code for the MARL-BC framework

Note: This repository is still a work in progress.
We are finalizing the code clean-up and will release the open-source version here in the coming days, and we will release this folder with the camera ready version of the paper.

The repository will include:

simulators.py : economic simulators where RL agents interact

gym_env.py    : the gym environments on which the algorithms run

training.py   : scripts and configuration files for training the various models

test.py       : evaluation tools for the neural networks trained in training
